# larceny-metadata
Imperceptible collection of information about the user and his device (local and virtual)

In the process of doing this work, I implemented the "theft" of data about the user and his device, both remotely and using a local program. 
I implemented 2 scripts in Python and JavaScript that collected this information and put it in a file, and then encrypted it. 
I managed to create a program that will perform "updates", implement a script that will collect user data and put it in a file, implement encoding of this file so that its contents cannot be found out, implement file protection from modification, implement disabling the script when entering a password, and also do the same for the web pages. I checked the functionality of the program and made sure that everything works correctly.
